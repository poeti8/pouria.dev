I'm not famous, and nobody has ever asked me what I use, however, I felt the urge to let everyone know about it. 

So let's start.

### Editor.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) has been my main code editor for the past ~3~ ~4~ +5 years. Love it.
- [Brackets Light Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fehey.brackets-light-pro) is the main theme I use (yes, I use a light theme).
- [ÔΩñÔΩÅÔΩêÔΩèÔΩíÔΩóÔΩÅÔΩñÔΩÖ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=this-fifo.vaporwave-theme-vscode) for when I switch to a dark theme.
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) font with ligatures enabled.

**Extensions:**

- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv): Syntax highlighting for .env files.
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): To lint JavaScript/TypeScript.
- [Multiple cursor case preserve](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cardinal90.multi-cursor-case-preserve): Preserve case when I use CMD/CTRL+D to find and replace texts. Very handy.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Format and beautify JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer): Provides support for Rust.
- [vscode-shader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader): Provides support for shader language.
- [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client): A minimal and simple REST API client that I prefer to apps like postman for most cases.
- [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight): Highlight TODO's in the code.
- [Toggle Quotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BriteSnow.vscode-toggle-quotes): Toggle between single-quotes, double-quotes and backticks. A real time saver.

**Other configurations:**

I've disabled the status bar, the activity bar, the minimap, breadcrumbs and basically any other visual noise if I ever notice them on the editor screen. Here are some notable configurations:


```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 16,
  "editor.lineHeight": 27,
  "files.defaultLanguage": "markdown",
  "editor.cursorWidth": 3,
  "editor.cursorBlinking": "phase",
  "editor.cursorSmoothCaretAnimation": true,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "breadcrumbs.enabled": false,
  "workbench.activityBar.visible": false,
  "workbench.statusBar.visible": false,
}
```
