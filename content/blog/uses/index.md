I'm not famous, and nobody has ever asked me what I use, however, I felt the urge to let everyone know about it. 

So let's start.

### Editor.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) has been my main code editor for the past ~3~ ~4~ +5 years. Love it.
- [Iceberg](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cocopon.iceberg-theme) is the main theme I use.
- [Brackets Light Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fehey.brackets-light-pro) for when I use a light theme.
- [ÔΩñÔΩÅÔΩêÔΩèÔΩíÔΩóÔΩÅÔΩñÔΩÖ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=this-fifo.vaporwave-theme-vscode) as the backup theme.
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) font with ligatures enabled.

**Extensions:**

- [Multiple cursor case preserve](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cardinal90.multi-cursor-case-preserve): Preserve case when I use CMD/CTRL+D to find and replace texts. Very handy.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Format and beautify JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- [vscode-shader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader): Provides support for shader language.
- [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight): Highlight TODO's in the code.
- [Toggle Quotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BriteSnow.vscode-toggle-quotes): Toggle between single-quotes, double-quotes and backticks. A real time saver.

**Other configurations:**

I've disabled the status bar, the activity bar, the minimap, breadcrumbs and basically any other visual noise if I ever notice them on the editor screen. I've also disabled linting and TypeScript checks so I don't see errors. I'll run commands on the terminal to perform those checks if needed.

Here are some notable configurations:


```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 15,
  "editor.lineHeight": 23,
  "editor.cursorWidth": 3,
  "editor.cursorBlinking": "phase",
  "editor.cursorSmoothCaretAnimation": true,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "breadcrumbs.enabled": false,
  "workbench.activityBar.visible": false,
  "workbench.statusBar.visible": false,
  "window.commandCenter": false,
  "workbench.layoutControl.enabled": false,
  "workbench.activityBar.location": "hidden",
  "eslint.enable": false,
  "javascript.validate.enable": false,
  "typescript.validate.enable": false
}
```
