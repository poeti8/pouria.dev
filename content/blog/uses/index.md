I'm not famous, nobody has ever asked me what I use, however, I felt the urge to tell you guys about it.
To be honest, it's also a good reference for me to set up my workflow in a new environment.

Let's start!

#### Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) has been my main editor for the past +3 years. Love it.
- [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) is the theme. Yes, I like puprle. A lot.
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) with ligatures on is the font I'm using.

Extensions:

- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2): Colorize brackets. Makes it easy to find the scope. Pretty too.
- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv): Syntax highlighting for .env files.
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Lint JavaScript and TypeScript. Constantly reminds me I'm stupid because of importing modules that I don't use.
- [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph): Git graphs inside editor.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Honestly, it has too many features I'm not even sure which ones I'm using.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Format and beautify code.
- [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager): Manage projects (Save, open, delete, etc).
- [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight): Highlight todos in the code.
- [Toggle Quotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BriteSnow.vscode-toggle-quotes): Toggle quotes. Very useful in JavaScript.
- [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components): styled-components syntax highlighter.
