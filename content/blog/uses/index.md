I'm not famous, nobody has ever asked me what I use, however, I felt the urge to tell you guys about it.
To be honest, it's also a good reference for me to set up my workflow in a new environment.

Let's start!

#### Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) has been my main editor for the past +3 years. Love it.
- [ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=this-fifo.vaporwave-theme-vscode) is the theme. Yes, I like puprle. A lot.
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) with ligatures on is the font I'm using.

Extensions:

- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv): Syntax highlighting for .env files.
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Lint JavaScript and TypeScript. Constantly reminds me I'm stupid because of importing modules that I don't use.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Format and beautify code.
- [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight): Highlight todos in the code.
- [Toggle Quotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BriteSnow.vscode-toggle-quotes): Toggle quotes. Very useful in JavaScript.
- [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components): styled-components syntax highlighter.

#### Desktop apps

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) + [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) is my default terminal. Using the same theme as VS Code with Meslo font.
- [Muse](https://github.com/xzzz9097/Muse) I control Spotify in touchbar with this little app.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), writing posts like this with it.
