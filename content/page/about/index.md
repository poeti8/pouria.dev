![me](me.jpg)

Hello there!

I'm unemployed, sorry I mean I'm **POURIA ðŸ¦‹**. Currently based in Tehran. 

I use web technologies such as TypeScript, React and Node.js to create things I find useful and interesting. Right now I'm fascinated by WebGL, Three.js, 3D graphics, math and generative art and music and I'm shifting my focus there.

I run a programming community called [The Devs](https://thedevs.network). I've created it in 2016, it's a network of groups on Telegram where everyone can chat, discuss and be in touch with their fellow coders. It has now more than 20 specialized groups and more than 33000 members on the main channel. 

I do some open source work too when I have free time:

- [Kutt](https://kutt.it): a "modern" URL shortener.
- [Telegram Directory](https://tgdr.io): Telegram directory to discover channels, bots and groups.
- [The Guard Bot](https://github.com/thedevs-network/the-guard-bot): A Telegram bot to moderate groups.

Check out my [my GitHub](https://github.com/poeti8) for more.
